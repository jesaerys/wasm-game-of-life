# Notes on the "Rust and WebAssembly" book

https://rustwasm.github.io/docs/book/introduction.html


## Setup

Installed `wasm-pack` with cargo: `cargo install wasm-pack`.

Installed `nvm` using the the official install script, then installed the latest
`npm` with `nvm install node`.


## Hello, World!

`src/lib.rs` is a little different than what's shown in the book, but it seems
to be basically the same. Same for the content generated by `wasm-pack build` in
the `pkg` directory.

Running `npm init wasm-app www` resulted in cloning the
[create-wasm-app](https://github.com/rustwasm/create-wasm-app) repo, commit
`9ac3dff` on branch `master`, into the `www` directory. I removed `www/.git`.
